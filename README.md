# TINT

**Tint** (The Italian NLP Tool) is a Java-based pipeline for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Italian.
It is very fast and accurate, and implements most of the common linguistic tools, such as part-of-speech tagging,
dependency parsing, entity linking.
The tool is based on [Stanford CoreNLP](http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/), and can be used
as a stand-alone tool, included as a Java library or as a REST API service.

Tint is a research-oriented project, and it is consantly under development. To compile the last version of Tint, you can [read this short tutorial](https://github.com/dhfbk/tint/wiki/Compiling-the-develop-version-of-Tint).
